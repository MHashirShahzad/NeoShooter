**Progression:**
1. A single bullet is in focus, and it is traveling slowly, the camera zooms out a little and shows a spaceship.
2. The spaceship dodges the bullet and the camera suddenly zooms out, revealing the entire stage.
3. Camera fades out.
4. Revealing the level-select screen. (Feels weird tho)
5. Showcase swap-able bullets
6. With the player at a constant position, swap levels at an increasing speed.
7. Increasing game-play intensity
8. Showcase abilities.
9. In the ending show the DRACONIC enemy charging the laser.
10. Suddenly End the trailer.
- Showcase different colored bullets.

# Suggestions
